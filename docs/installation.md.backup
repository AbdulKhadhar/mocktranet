# Mocktranet installation
As the _mocktranet_ is a basic HTML site it requires very few resources to run and very little web server configuration.

Example configuration files are offered in the `configs` directory for the following configurations:

* Apache2 on Debian / Ubuntu
* Nginx on Debian / Ubuntu

Pre-built configuration files assume the _mocktranet_ `web` directory is stored at `/var/www/mocktranet`.
