# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcomed but there's a few rules:

* Mocktranet is designed to just require a basic webserver - so no ASP.net, PHP, Django etc.  Just HTML, Javascript and CSS please
* Comments and contributions should be respectful to everyone involved in the project or that could use Mocktranet
* Stick to code style wherever possible (see existing source)

## Licensing
If you are adding content, please remember Mocktranet is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.  Similarly, if you're adding assets from other projects (the beauty of open source) please ensure they use the same, or a compatible, license.
